**! This project is currently inactive !**

I do not plan on adding any more challenges for the time being, or fix any of the bugs (including the one that leaks all flags).
If anyone wishes to do so, you can freely fork/clone this repository. 

This is a small site created to help introduce cybersecurity and provide beginner-friendly cybersecurity challenges.

**Current number of challenges: 11**
